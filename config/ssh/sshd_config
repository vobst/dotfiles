PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Only for Yubikey resident ssh keys. Forces userVerification on client 
# side. Good if key is lost but PIN still secret.
# Can also be forced per key by appending: verify-required to 
# .ssh/auth_keys (e.g. if system sshd is not enforcing it an user wants 
# extra protection).
# However, the best thing is to generate the resident key with option
# -O verify_required so it is always protected by userVerification
# regardless of remote settings.
